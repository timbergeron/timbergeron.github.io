v2.018 (BUILD:6/26/2018)
-------
. mwheelscrolling for menus; mouse1 for enter mouse2 for back

. fixed: server list as servers.quakeone.com went down.(pulls a default server.txt from quakeone.com/qrack)

. added support for external .ogg/.mp3 music put your music tracks in /quake/{gamedir}/music/ naming files track##.{ogg}mp3} 
	use 'fmod_music' command to toggle loading/playing external music. (requires reloading map)
	add +fmod_music to your command line or edit your autoexec.cfg and add fmod_music to the bottom.
	
. disabled playing cd tracks when using timedemo!

. changed cl_basespeedkey default value to 200. This is the median speed point between always run on or off. 
	If forward speed is greater then basespeedkey then current speed will be reduced by the value of cl_basespeedkey when pressing +speed.
	if cl_basespeedkey is 0 then +speed only multiplies current movement by cl_movespeedkey.
	
. Fixed QMB Particles with Fog Enabled.

. Added BSP2 support with extended limits. 

. Fixed ED_LoadFromFile bug on jrdm2 map.
